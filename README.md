# 💼 CareerConnect — MERN Job Portal Web App

CareerConnect is a full-stack job portal application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**. It allows recruiters to post jobs and manage applicants, while job seekers can browse listings and apply to opportunities. This project was built by following a complete tutorial as part of my learning journey in full-stack development.
